Society for Promotion of Undergraduate Research (SPUR) has been formed as an initiative of the General Secretary of Academic Affairs '12-'13. The first initiative of SPUR is the Institute Summer Project Allocation (ISPA). Professors from all the Departments are being approached for floating projects for second year and first year students (primarily second year students). There will be a central online portal on which project details from all Departments will be put up. Students will login with their LDAP ID on the portal and will be asked to fill their preferences. Interviews will be later fixed with the respective Professors and projects will be allocated to the students selected by the Professors.
